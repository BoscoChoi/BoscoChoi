👋 Hi, I’m an urban planning student at UCL with an interest in data-driven approaches to urban planning and design.

I’m currently building Python-based projects to explore urban issues, combining spatial data, policy analysis, and quantitative methods. I'm still learning and experimenting!

| **Housing near train stations**    | Recently, the UK government announced to give "default yes" to housing applications near train stations. Is this a good idea? Where are the opportunity areas for further densification? I investigated the past planning applications database and employed K-Means clustering to answer the question.   | [Visit Site](https://boscochoi.github.io/Housing_Default_Yes_Project/qm_final_assm.html)    |
| **Airbnb in London**    | This group project explores whether Airbnb is out of control in London. It was prepared as a policy brief to the "Mayor" in a hypothetical scenario.      | [Visit Site](https://benjamintee.github.io/CASA_FSDS_Project/Group_Work.html)    |
