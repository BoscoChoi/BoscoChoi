👋 Hi, I’m an urban planning student at UCL with an interest in data-driven approaches to urban planning and design.

I’m currently building Python-based projects to explore urban issues, combining spatial data, policy analysis, and quantitative methods. I'm still learning and experimenting!

| **Airbnb in London**    | This group project explores whether Airbnb is out of control in London. It was prepared as a policy brief to the "Mayor" in a hypothetical scenario.      | [Visit Site](https://benjamintee.github.io/CASA_FSDS_Project/Group_Work.html)    |
| **Housing near train stations**    | This independent project investgates whether the recent UK government announcement to give a "default yes" to housing applications near train stations is a good idea. I mainly looked into the planning applications database to identify past trends, and used K-Means clustering to identify opportunity areas for further densification.     | [Visit Site](https://boscochoi.github.io/Housing_Default_Yes_Project/qm_final_assm.html)    |
